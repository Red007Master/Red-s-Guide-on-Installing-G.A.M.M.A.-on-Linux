Main problem would be using `gamma-launcher`, to be more precise looks like libunrar is not available to be easily/natively installed and used.   
You have two options:
- 1 Use Distrobox and do GAMMA install from inside of it.
- 2 Sideload libunrar binary, more about it [here](https://github.com/Red007Master/Red-s-Guide-on-Installing-G.A.M.M.A.-on-Linux/issues/6).
